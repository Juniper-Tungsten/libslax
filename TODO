The List of Things I Should Be Doing (if I weren't so busy making this list) 

- Test: portability
  - cygwin, macos, freebsd, linux, etc

- Feature: Conditional breakpoints

- Feature: "checkout" or compile-only mode --check/-c
  load and compile a script, but do not run it

- Feature: better error messages.  Please.

- Doc: Make man page for libslax (public API)

- Doc: "..." operator

- Feature: add "-c" --check option

- Feature: parser issue warnings if 1.1 features with 1.0 version

- Feature: slaxwriter must avoid 1.1 features if version 1.0 is requested

- Code: move code that can be reused from slaxproc.c into libslax/
  callbacks for slaxInput and slaxOutput; make wrapper setup() function.

- Code: move slaxTrace, slaxOutput, slaxInput, etc to new file

- Code: s/slaxTrace(/slaxLog(/ and s/-V/-l/

- Code: functions to parse our arguments/table

- slaxproc: -I <path>

- sdb: add SLAX-style xpath expressions to the "print" command (">==", etc)

- sdb: up, down, and stack-sensitive "print"

- sdb: "frame" command to display detailed information about a stack frame
  including local variables, context node, etc

- Bug: line numbers are off if file doesn't end in NL

- Bug: need better random generator for math:random than rand(3)

- Nit: teach slaxProcTrace() how to keep the trace handle open

- Nit: make sdb's "run" command work like gdb's

- Nit: add command line option for profiler (without entering debugger)
