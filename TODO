The List of Things I Should Be Doing (if I weren't so busy making this list) 

- Test portability
  - cygwin, macos, freebsd, linux, etc

- Conditional breakpoints

- BUG: line numbers are off if file doesn't end in NL

- Make man page for libslax (public API)

- Mutable variables:
  mvar $x = 1;
  set $x = <number> 4;
  set $x += <number> 5;

- BUG: need better random generator for math:random than rand(3)

- sdb: add SLAX-style xpath expressions to the "print" command ("==", etc)

- Nit: teach slaxProcTrace() how to keep the trace handle open

- Nit: make sdb's "run" command work like gdb's
