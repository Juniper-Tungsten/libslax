The List of Things I Should Be Doing (if I weren't so busy making this list) 

- Test: portability
  - Have tested: cygwin, macos, freebsd, ubuntu
  - Need more

- Doc: Make man page for libslax (public API)

- Feature: parser issue warnings if 1.1 features with 1.0 version

- Code: functions to parse our arguments/table

- slaxproc: -I <path>

- sdb: Conditional breakpoints

- sdb: up, down, and stack-sensitive "print"

- sdb: "frame" command to display detailed information about a stack frame
  including local variables ("info locals"), context node, etc

- Bug: line numbers are off if file doesn't end in NL

- Bug: foo("\"") needs to use single quotes for the wrapping string
    (&apos;&quot;&apos;).  I don't know of a fix when both types of
    quotes appear within a single string, which is just sad.

- Nit: teach slaxProcTrace() how to keep the trace handle open

- Nit: make sdb's "run" command work like gdb's (the first time in a script)

- Nit: add command line option for profiler (without entering debugger)

- Check: confirm that UTF-8 encoding functions are working correctly

- Nit: Put _all_ debugger info in statep; also s/dsfp/stp/

- Doc: new reload command

- sdb: add "reload data" command (default to "reload script")
