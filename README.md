# libslax

Welcome to libslax, an implementation of the SLAX language, an
alternate syntax for XSLT that follow the patterns of C and Perl.
This library builds on the most excellent work of Daniel Veillard
et al in the [libxml2 and libxslt libraries](http://xmlsoft.org),
for which I heartily give thanks.

More information is available in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/Juniper/libslax/wiki).
