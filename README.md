# libslax

Welcome to libslax, an implementation of the SLAX syntax for XSLT.
This library builds on the most excellent work of Daniel Veillard et
al in the libxml2 and libxslt libraries, for which I greatfully give
thanks.

More information is available in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/Juniper/libslax/wiki).
