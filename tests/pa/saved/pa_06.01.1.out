877 : 0x4db4 -> 0x2000000126d0 [lordship over them, gave a great impetus to the development of their]
878 : 0x4da2 -> 0x200000012688 [culture, and started at once the institution of monarchy, the knowledge]
879 : 0x4d90 -> 0x200000012640 [of letters, and the use of metals. The chiefs of this superior tribe]
880 : 0x4d7f -> 0x2000000125fc [founded the monarchy, conquered the North, unified the kingdom, and]
881 : 0x4d6d -> 0x2000000125b4 [began Egyptian history. From many indications it would seem probable]
882 : 0x4d5b -> 0x20000001256c [that these conquerors were of Babylonian origin, or that the culture]
883 : 0x4d4b -> 0x20000001252c [they brought with them (possibly from Arabia) was ultimately of]
884 : 0x4d3a -> 0x2000000124e8 [Babylonian origin. They themselves would seem to have been Semites,]
885 : 0x4d29 -> 0x2000000124a4 [or rather proto-Semites, who came from Arabia to Africa by way of]
886 : 0x4d17 -> 0x20000001245c [the straits of Bab el-Mandeb, and proceeded up the coast to about the]
887 : 0x4d05 -> 0x200000012414 [neighbourhood of Kusêr, whence the Wadi Hammamat offered them an open]
888 : 0x4cf4 -> 0x2000000123d0 [road to the valley of the Nile. By this route they may have entered]
889 : 0x4ce2 -> 0x200000012388 [Egypt, bringing with them a civilization, which, like that of the other]
890 : 0x4cd1 -> 0x200000012344 [Semites, had been profoundly influenced and modified by that of the]
891 : 0x4cc0 -> 0x200000012300 [Sumerian inhabitants of Babylonia. This Semitic-Sumerian culture,]
892 : 0x4cae -> 0x2000000122b8 [mingling with that of the Nilotes themselves, produced the civilization]
893 : 0x4ca6 -> 0x200000012298 [of Ancient Egypt as we know it.]
894 : 0x1 -> 0x10d6e9603 []
895 : 0x4c93 -> 0x20000001224c [This is a very plausible hypothesis, and has a great deal of evidence in]
896 : 0x4c82 -> 0x200000012208 [its favour. It seems certain that in the early dynastic period two]
897 : 0x4c70 -> 0x2000000121c0 [races lived in Egypt, which differed considerably in type, and also,]
898 : 0x4c5e -> 0x200000012178 [apparently, in burial customs. The later Egyptians always buried the]
899 : 0x4c4b -> 0x20000001212c [dead lying on their backs, extended at full length. During the period of]
900 : 0x4c39 -> 0x2000000120e4 [the Middle Kingdom (XIth-XIIIth Dynasties) the head was usually turned]
901 : 0x4c27 -> 0x20000001209c [over on to the left side, in order that the dead man might look through]
902 : 0x4c15 -> 0x200000012054 [the two great eyes painted on that side of the coffin. Afterward the]
903 : 0x4c03 -> 0x20000001200c [rigidly extended position was always adopted. The Neolithic Egyptians,]
904 : 0x4bf3 -> 0x200000011fcc [however, buried the dead lying wholly on the left side and in a]
905 : 0x4be1 -> 0x200000011f84 [contracted position, with the knees drawn up to the chin. The bodies]
906 : 0x4bd0 -> 0x200000011f40 [were not embalmed, and the extended position and mummification were]
907 : 0x4bbe -> 0x200000011ef8 [never used. Under the IVth Dynasty we find in the necropolis of Mêdûm]
908 : 0x4bac -> 0x200000011eb0 [(north of the Payyûm) the two positions used simultaneously, and the]
909 : 0x4b9a -> 0x200000011e68 [extended bodies are mummified. The contracted bodies are skeletons, as]
910 : 0x4b87 -> 0x200000011e1c [in the case of most of the predynastic bodies. When these are found with]
911 : 0x4b75 -> 0x200000011dd4 [flesh, skin, and hair intact, their preservation is due to the dryness]
912 : 0x4b63 -> 0x200000011d8c [of the soil and the preservative salts it contains, not to intentional]
913 : 0x4b52 -> 0x200000011d48 [embalming, which was evidently introduced by those who employed the]
914 : 0x4b3f -> 0x200000011cfc [extended position in burial. The contracted position is found as late as]
915 : 0x4b2c -> 0x200000011cb0 [the Vth Dynasty at Dashasha, south of the Eayyûm, but after that date it]
916 : 0x4b27 -> 0x200000011c9c [is no longer found.]
917 : 0x1 -> 0x10d6e9603 []
918 : 0x4b17 -> 0x200000011c5c [The conclusion is obvious that the contracted position without]
919 : 0x4b05 -> 0x200000011c14 [mummification, which the Neolithic people used, was supplanted in the]
920 : 0x4af3 -> 0x200000011bcc [early dynastic period by the extended position with mummification, and]
921 : 0x4ae1 -> 0x200000011b84 [by the time of the VIth Dynasty it was entirely superseded. This points]
922 : 0x4acf -> 0x200000011b3c [to the supersession of the burial customs of the indigenous Neolithic]

924 : 0x4aae -> 0x200000011ab8 [indigenes. And, since the extended burials of the IVth Dynasty are]
925 : 0x4a9d -> 0x200000011a74 [evidently those of the higher nobles, while the contracted ones are]
926 : 0x4a8b -> 0x200000011a2c [those of inferior people, it is probable that the customs of extended]
927 : 0x4a78 -> 0x2000000119e0 [burial and embalming were introduced by a foreign race which founded the]
928 : 0x4a66 -> 0x200000011998 [Egyptian monarchical state, with its hierarchy of nobles and officials,]
929 : 0x4a54 -> 0x200000011950 [and in fact started Egyptian civilization on its way. The conquerors of]
930 : 0x4a42 -> 0x200000011908 [the North were thus not the descendants of the Neolithic people of the]
931 : 0x4a30 -> 0x2000000118c0 [South, but their conquerors; in fact, they dominated the indigenes both]
932 : 0x4a1e -> 0x200000011878 [of North and South, who will then appear (since we find the custom of]
933 : 0x4a0b -> 0x20000001182c [contracted burial in the North at Dashasha and Mêdûm) to have originally]
934 : 0x4a04 -> 0x200000011810 [belonged to the same race.]

941 : 0x49b8 -> 0x2000000116e0 [(1) Just as the Egyptian race was evidently compounded of two elements,]
942 : 0x49a5 -> 0x200000011694 [of conquered "Mediterraneans" and conquering x, so the Egyptian language]
943 : 0x4994 -> 0x200000011650 [is evidently compounded of two elements, the one Nilotic, perhaps]
944 : 0x4981 -> 0x200000011604 [related in some degree to the Berber dialects of North Africa, the other]

948 : 0x4955 -> 0x200000011554 [appear in that of the earlier pre-dynastic period, resemble well-known]
949 : 0x4943 -> 0x20000001150c [elements of the civilization of Babylonia. We may instance the use of]
950 : 0x4931 -> 0x2000000114c4 [the cylinder-seal, which died out in Egypt in the time of the XVIIIth]
951 : 0x4920 -> 0x200000011480 [Dynasty, but was always used in Babylonia from the earliest to the]
952 : 0x490f -> 0x20000001143c [latest times. The early Egyptian mace-head is of exactly the same]
953 : 0x48fd -> 0x2000000113f4 [type as the early Babylonian one. In the British Museum is an Egyptian]
954 : 0x48ec -> 0x2000000113b0 [mace-head of red breccia, which is identical in shape and size with]
955 : 0x48dd -> 0x200000011374 [one from Babylonia (also in the museum) bearing the name of]
956 : 0x48cc -> 0x200000011330 [Shargani-shar-ali (i.e. Sargon, King of Agade), one of the earliest]
957 : 0x48bb -> 0x2000000112ec [Chaldæan monarchs, who must have lived about the same time as the]

961 : 0x4872 -> 0x2000000111c8 [Babylonia. It is not till the time of the IId Dynasty that Egyptian art]
962 : 0x4860 -> 0x200000011180 [begins to take upon itself the regular form which we know so well, and]
963 : 0x484d -> 0x200000011134 [not till that of the IVth that this form was finally crystallized. Under]
964 : 0x483b -> 0x2000000110ec [the 1st Dynasty we find the figure of man or, to take other instances,]
965 : 0x4829 -> 0x2000000110a4 [that of a lion, or a hawk, or a snake, often treated in a style very]
966 : 0x4817 -> 0x20000001105c [different from that in which we are accustomed to see a man, a lion, a]
967 : 0x4804 -> 0x200000011010 [hawk, or a snake depicted in works of the later period. And the striking]
968 : 0x47f2 -> 0x200000010fc8 [thing is that these early representations, which differ so much from]
969 : 0x47e1 -> 0x200000010f84 [what we find in later Egyptian art, curiously resemble the works of]
970 : 0x47cf -> 0x200000010f3c [early Babylonian art, of the time of the patesis of Shirpurla or the]

980 : 0x471b -> 0x200000010c6c [are curiously alike in their clumsy, naïve style of art. A further]
981 : 0x4709 -> 0x200000010c24 [point is that the official represented on the stele, who appears to be]
982 : 0x46f7 -> 0x200000010bdc [thrusting one of the bound captives out to die, wears a long fringed]

992 : 0x4666 -> 0x200000010998 [hawks, and crocodiles. On the other hand, we have a sun and sky worship]
