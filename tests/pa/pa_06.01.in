k65 PUBLISHERS' NOTE
k66 
k67 It should be noted that many of the monuments and sites of excavations
k68 in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Kurdistan described in this volume
k69 have been visited by the authors in connection with their own work in
k70 those countries. The greater number of the photographs here published
k71 were taken by the authors themselves. Their thanks are due to M. Ernest
k72 Leroux, of Paris, for his kind permission to reproduce a certain number
k73 of plates from the works of M. de Morgan, illustrating his recent
k74 discoveries in Egypt and Persia, and to Messrs. W. A. Mansell & Co., of
k75 London, for kindly allowing them to make use of a number of photographs
k76 issued by them.

k81 PREFACE
k82 
k83 The present volume contains an account of the most important additions
k84 which have been made to our knowledge of the ancient history of Egypt
k85 and Western Asia during the few years which have elapsed since the
k86 publication of Prof. Maspero's _Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de
k87 l'Orient Classique_, and includes short descriptions of the excavations
k88 from which these results have been obtained. It is in no sense a
k89 connected and continuous history of these countries, for that has
k90 already been written by Prof. Maspero, but is rather intended as an
k91 appendix or addendum to his work, briefly recapitulating and describing
k92 the discoveries made since its appearance. On this account we
k93 have followed a geographical rather than a chronological system of
k94 arrangement, but at the same time the attempt has been made to suggest
k95 to the mind of the reader the historical sequence of events.
k96 
k97 At no period have excavations been pursued with more energy and
k98 activity, both in Egypt and Western Asia, than at the present time, and
k99 every season's work obliges us to modify former theories, and extends
k100 our knowledge of periods of history which even ten years ago were
k101 unknown to the historian. For instance, a whole chapter has been added
k102 to Egyptian history by the discovery of the Neolithic culture of the
k103 primitive Egyptians, while the recent excavations at Susa are revealing
k104 a hitherto totally unsuspected epoch of proto-Elamite civilization.
k105 Further than this, we have discovered the relics of the oldest
k106 historical kings of Egypt, and we are now enabled to reconstitute from
k107 material as yet unpublished the inter-relations of the early dynasties
k108 of Babylon. Important discoveries have also been made with regard to
k109 isolated points in the later historical periods. We have therefore
k110 attempted to include the most important of these in our survey of recent
k111 excavations and their results. We would again remind the reader that
k112 Prof. Maspero's great work must be consulted for the complete history of
k113 the period, the present volume being, not a connected history of Egypt
k114 and Western Asia, but a description and discussion of the manner in
k115 which recent discovery and research have added to and modified our
k116 conceptions of ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization.

k153 CHAPTER I--THE DISCOVERY OF PREHISTORIC EGYPT
k154 
k155 During the last ten years our conception of the beginnings of Egyptian
k156 antiquity has profoundly altered. When Prof. Maspero published the
k157 first volume of his great _Histoire Ancienne des Peuples des l'Orient
k158 Classique_, in 1895, Egyptian history, properly so called, still began
k159 with the Pyramid-builders, Sne-feru, Khufu, and Khafra (Cheops and
k160 Chephren), and the legendary lists of earlier kings preserved at Abydos
k161 and Sakkara were still quoted as the only source of knowledge of the
k162 time before the IVth Dynasty. Of a prehistoric Egypt nothing was known,
k163 beyond a few flint flakes gathered here and there upon the desert
k164 plateaus, which might or might not tell of an age when the ancestors
k165 of the Pyramid-builders knew only the stone tools and weapons of the
k166 primeval savage.
k167 
k168 Now, however, the veil which has hidden the beginnings of Egyptian
k169 civilization from us has been lifted, and we see things, more or less,
k170 as they actually were, unobscured by the traditions of a later day.
k171 Until the last few years nothing of the real beginnings of history in
k172 either Egypt or Mesopotamia had been found; legend supplied the only
k173 material for the reconstruction of the earliest history of the oldest
k174 civilized nations of the globe. Nor was it seriously supposed that any
k175 relics of prehistoric Egypt or Mesopotamia ever would be found. The
k176 antiquity of the known history of these countries already appeared
k177 so great that nobody took into consideration the possibility of our
k178 discovering a prehistoric Egypt or Mesopotamia; the idea was too remote
k179 from practical work. And further, civilization in these countries had
k180 lasted so long that it seemed more than probable that all traces
k181 of their prehistoric age had long since been swept away. Yet the
k182 possibility, which seemed hardly worth a moment's consideration in 1895,
k183 is in 1905 an assured reality, at least as far as Egypt is concerned.
k184 Prehistoric Babylonia has yet to be discovered. It is true, for example,
k185 that at Mukay-yar, the site of ancient Ur of the Chaldees, burials
k186 in earthenware coffins, in which the skeletons lie in the doubled-up
k187 position characteristic of Neolithic interments, have been found; but
k188 there is no doubt whatever that these are burials of a much later date,
k189 belonging, quite possibly, to the Parthian period. Nothing that may
k190 rightfully be termed prehistoric has yet been found in the Euphrates
k191 valley, whereas in Egypt prehistoric antiquities are now almost as well
k192 known and as well represented in our museums as are the prehistoric
k193 antiquities of Europe and America.
k194 
k195 With the exception of a few palasoliths from the surface of the Syrian
k196 desert, near the Euphrates valley, not a single implement of the Age
k197 of Stone has yet been found in Southern Mesopotamia, whereas Egypt
k198 has yielded to us the most perfect examples of the flint-knapper's
k199 art known, flint tools and weapons more beautiful than the finest that
k200 Europe and America can show. The reason is not far to seek. Southern
k201 Mesopotamia is an alluvial country, and the ancient cities, which
k202 doubtless mark the sites of the oldest settlements in the land, are
k203 situated in the alluvial marshy plain between the Tigris and the
k204 Euphrates; so that all traces of the Neolithic culture of the country
k205 would seem to have disappeared, buried deep beneath city-mounds, clay
k206 and marsh. It is the same in the Egyptian Delta, a similar country; and
k207 here no traces of the prehistoric culture of Egypt have been found. The
k208 attempt to find them was made last year at Buto, which is known to be
k209 one of the most antique centres of civilization, and probably was one of
k210 the earliest settlements in Egypt, but without success. The infiltration
k211 of water had made excavation impossible and had no doubt destroyed
k212 everything belonging to the most ancient settlement. It is not going too
k213 far to predict that exactly the same thing will be found by any explorer
k214 who tries to discover a Neolithic stratum beneath a city-mound of
k215 Babylonia. There is little hope that prehistoric Chaldæa will ever be
k216 known to us. But in Egypt the conditions are different. The Delta is
k217 like Babylonia, it is true; but in the Upper Nile valley the river flows
k218 down with but a thin border of alluvial land on either side, through the
k219 rocky and hilly desert, the dry Sahara, where rain falls but once in two
k220 or three years. Antiquities buried in this soil in the most remote
k221 ages are preserved intact as they were first interred, until the modern
k222 investigator comes along to look for them. And it is on the desert
k223 margin of the valley that the remains of prehistoric Egypt have been
k224 found. That is the reason for their perfect preservation till our own
k225 day, and why we know prehistoric Egypt so well.
k226 
k227 The chief work of Egyptian civilization was the proper irrigation of
k228 the alluvial soil, the turning of marsh into cultivated fields, and the
k229 reclamation of land from the desert for the purposes of agriculture.
k230 Owing to the rainless character of the country, the only means
k231 of obtaining water for the crops is by irrigation, and where the
k232 fertilizing Nile water cannot be taken by means of canals, there
k233 cultivation ends and the desert begins. Before Egyptian civilization,
k234 properly so called, began, the valley was a great marsh through which
k235 the Nile found its way north to the sea. The half-savage, stone-using
k236 ancestors of the civilized Egyptians hunted wild fowl, crocodiles,
k237 and hippopotami in the marshy valley; but except in a few isolated
k238 settlements on convenient mounds here and there (the forerunners of the
k239 later villages), they did not live there. Their settlements were on
k240 the dry desert margin, and it was here, upon low tongues of desert hill
k241 jutting out into the plain, that they buried their dead. Their simple
k242 shallow graves were safe from the flood, and, but for the depredations
k243 of jackals and hyenas, here they have remained intact till our own
k244 day, and have yielded up to us the facts from which we have derived our
k245 knowledge of prehistoric Egypt. Thus it is that we know so much of the
k246 Egyptians of the Stone Age, while of their contemporaries in Mesopotamia
k247 we know nothing, nor is anything further likely to be discovered.
k248 
k249 But these desert cemeteries, with their crowds of oval shallow graves,
k250 covered by only a few inches of surface soil, in which the Neolithic
k251 Egyptians lie crouched up with their flint implements and polished
k252 pottery beside them, are but monuments of the later age of prehistoric
k253 Egypt. Long before the Neolithic Egyptian hunted his game in the
k254 marshes, and here and there essayed the work of reclamation for the
k255 purposes of an incipient agriculture, a far older race inhabited the
k256 valley of the Nile. The written records of Egyptian civilization go back
k257 four thousand years before Christ, or earlier, and the Neolithic Age of
k258 Egypt must go back to a period several thousand years before that. But
k259 we can now go back much further still, to the Palaeolithic Age of Egypt.
k260 At a time when Europe was still covered by the ice and snows of the
k261 Glacial Period, and man fought as an equal, hardly yet as a superior,
k262 with cave-bear and mammoth, the Palaeolithic Egyptians lived on the
k263 banks of the Nile. Their habitat was doubtless the desert slopes, often,
k264 too, the plateaus themselves; but that they lived entirely upon the
k265 plateaus, high up above the Nile marsh, is improbable. There, it is
k266 true, we find their flint implements, the great pear-shaped weapons of
k267 the types of Chelles, St. Acheul, and Le Moustier, types well known
k268 to all who are acquainted with the flint implements of the "Drift" in
k269 Europe. And it is there that the theory, generally accepted hitherto,
k270 has placed the habitat of the makers and users of these implements.
k271 
k272 The idea was that in Palaeolithic days, contemporary with the Glacial
k273 Age of Northern Europe and America, the climate of Egypt was entirely
k274 different from that of later times and of to-day. Instead of dry desert,
k275 the mountain plateaus bordering the Nile valley were supposed to have
k276 been then covered with forest, through which flowed countless streams
k277 to feed the river below. It was suggested that remains of these streams
k278 were to be seen in the side ravines, or wadis, of the Nile valley, which
k279 run up from the low desert on the river level into the hills on either
k280 hand. These wadis undoubtedly show extensive traces of strong water
k281 action; they curve and twist as the streams found their easiest way
k282 to the level through the softer strata, they are heaped up with great
k283 water-worn boulders, they are hollowed out where waterfalls once fell.
k284 They have the appearance of dry watercourses, exactly what any mountain
k285 burns would be were the water-supply suddenly cut off for ever, the
k286 climate altered from rainy to eternal sun-glare, and every plant and
k287 tree blasted, never to grow again. Acting on the supposition that this
k288 idea was a correct one, most observers have concluded that the climate
k289 of Egypt in remote periods was very different from the dry, rainless one
k290 now obtaining. To provide the water for the wadi streams, heavy
k291 rainfall and forests are desiderated. They were easily supplied, on the
k292 hypothesis. Forests clothed the mountain plateaus, heavy rains fell, and
k293 the water rushed down to the Nile, carving out the great watercourses
k294 which remain to this day, bearing testimony to the truth. And the
k295 flints, which the Palaeolithic inhabitants of the plateau-forests made
k296 and used, still lie on the now treeless and sun-baked desert surface.
k297 
k298 [Illustration: 007.jpg THE BED OF AN ANCIENT WATERCOURSE IN THE WADIYÊN,
k299 THEBES.]
k300 
k301 This is certainly a very weak conclusion. In fact, it seriously damages
k302 the whole argument, the water-courses to the contrary notwithstanding.
k303 The palæoliths are there. They can be picked up by any visitor. There
k304 they lie, great flints of the Drift types, just like those found in the
k305 gravel-beds of England and Belgium, on the desert surface where they
k306 were made. Undoubtedly where they were made, for the places where
k307 they lie are the actual ancient flint workshops, where the flints were
k308 chipped. Everywhere around are innumerable flint chips and perfect
k309 weapons, burnt black and patinated by ages of sunlight. We are taking
k310 one particular spot in the hills of Western Thebes as an example, but
k311 there are plenty of others, such as the Wadi esh-Shêkh on the right bank
k312 of the Nile opposite Maghagha, whence Mr. H. Seton-Karr has brought
k313 back specimens of flint tools of all ages from the Palaeolithic to the
k314 Neolithic periods.
k315 
k316 The Palæolithic flint workshops on the Theban hills have been visited of
k317 late years by Mr. Seton-Karr, by Prof. Schweinfurth, Mr. Allen Sturge,
k318 and Dr. Blanckenhorn, by Mr. Portch, Mr. Ayrton, and Mr. Hall. The
k319 weapons illustrated here were found by Messrs. Hall and Ayrton, and are
k320 now preserved in the British Museum. Among these flints shown we notice
k321 two fine specimens of the pear-shaped type of St. Acheul, with curious
k322 adze-shaped implements of primitive type to left and right. Below, to
k323 the right, is a very primitive instrument of Chellean type, being merely
k324 a sharpened pebble. Above, to left and right, are two specimens of the
k325 curious half-moon-shaped instruments which are characteristic of
k326 the Theban flint field and are hardly known elsewhere. All have the
k327 beautiful brown patina, which only ages of sunburn can give. The
k328 "poignard" type to the left, at the bottom of the plate, is broken off
k329 short.
k330 
k331 [Illustration: 008.jpg Palaeolithic Implements of the Quaternary Period.
k332 From the desert plateau and slopes west of Thebes.]
k333 
k334 In the smaller illustration we see some remarkable types: two scrapers
k335 or knives with strongly marked "bulb of percussion" (the spot where the
k336 flint-knapper struck and from which the flakes flew off), a very regular
k337 _coup-de-poing_ which looks almost like a large arrowhead, and on the
k338 right a much weathered and patinated scraper which must be of immemorial
k339 age.
k340 
k341 [Illustration: 009.jpg (right): PALAEOLITHIC IMPLEMENTS. From Man,
k342 March, 1905.]
k343 
k344 This came from the top plateau, not from the slopes (or subsidiary
k345 plateaus at the head of the _wadis_), as did the great St. Acheulian
k346 weapons. The circular object is very remarkable: it is the half of the
k347 ring of a "morpholith "(a round flinty accretion often found in the
k348 Theban limestone) which has been split, and the split (flat) side
k349 carefully bevelled. Several of these interesting objects have been
k350 found in conjunction with Palæolithic implements at Thebes. No doubt the
k351 flints lie on the actual surface where they were made. No later water
k352 action has swept them away and covered them with gravel, no later human
k353 habitation has hidden them with successive deposits of soil, no gradual
k354 deposit of dust and rubbish has buried them deep. They lie as they were
k355 left in the far-away Palæolithic Age, and they have lain there till
k356 taken away by the modern explorer.
k357 
k358 But this is not the case with all the Palæolithic flints of Thebes. In
k359 the year 1882 Maj.-Gen. Pitt-Rivers discovered Palæolithic flints in the
k360 deposit of diluvial detritus which lies between the cultivation and the
k361 mountains on the west bank of the Nile opposite Luxor. Many of these are
k362 of the same type as those found on the surface of the mountain plateau
k363 which lies at the head of the great _wadi_ of the Tombs of the Kings,
k364 while the diluvial deposit is at its mouth. The stuff of which the
k365 detritus is composed evidently came originally from the high plateau,
k366 and was washed down, with the flints, in ancient times.
k367 
k368 This is quite conceivable, but how is it that the flints left behind
k369 on the plateau remain on the original ancient surface? How is it
k370 conceivable that if (on the old theory) these plateaus were in
k371 Palæolithic days clothed with forest, the Palæolithic flints could even
k372 in a single instance remain undisturbed from Palæolithic times to the
k373 present day, when the forest in which they were made and the forest soil
k374 on which they reposed have entirely disappeared? If there were woods and
k375 forests On the heights, it would seem impossible that we should find,
k376 as we do, Palæolithic implements lying in situ on the desert surface,
k377 around the actual manufactories where they were made. Yet if the
k378 constant rainfall and the vegetation of the Libyan desert area in
k379 Palæolithic days is all a myth (as it most probably is), how came the
k380 embedded palaeoliths, found by Gen. Pitt-Rivers, in the bed of diluvial
k381 detritus which is apparently _débris_ from the plateau brought down by
k382 the Palæolithic _wadi_ streams?
k383 
k384 Water erosion has certainly formed the Theban _wadis_. But this water
k385 erosion was probably not that which would be the result of perennial
k386 streams flowing down from wooded heights, but of torrents like those
k387 of to-day, which fill the _wadis_ once in three years or so after heavy
k388 rain, but repeated at much closer intervals. We may in fact suppose
k389 just so much difference in meteorological conditions as would make it
k390 possible for sudden rain-storms to occur over the desert at far more
k391 frequent intervals than at present. That would account for the detritus
k392 bed at the mouth of the _wadi_, and its embedded flints, and at the
k393 same time maintain the general probability of the idea that the desert
k394 plateaus were desert in Palæolithic days as now, and that early man only
k395 knapped his flints up there because he found the flint there. He himself
k396 lived on the slopes and nearer the marsh.
k397 
k398 This new view seems to be much sounder and more probable than the old
k399 one, maintained by Flinders Petrie and Blanckenhorn, according to which
k400 the high plateau was the home of man in Palæolithic times, when the
k401 rainfall, as shown by the valley erosion and waterfalls, must have
k402 caused an abundant vegetation on the plateau, where man could live and
k403 hunt his game. [*Petrie, Nagada and Ballas, p. 49.] Were this so, it
k404 is patent that the Palæolithic flints could not have been found on the
k405 desert surface as they are. Mr. H. J. L. Beadnell, of the Geological
k406 Survey of Egypt, to whom we are indebted for the promulgation of the
k407 more modern and probable view, says: "Is it certain that the high
k408 plateau was then clothed with forests? What evidence is there to show
k409 that it differed in any important respect from its present aspect? And
k410 if, as I suggest, desert conditions obtained then as now, and man merely
k411 worked his flints along the edges of the plateaus overlooking the
k412 Nile valley, I see no reason why flint implements, dating even from
k413 Palæolithic times should not in favourable cases still be found in
k414 the spots where they were left, surrounded by the flakes struck off in
k415 manufacture. On the flat plateaus the occasional rains which fall--once
k416 in three or four years--can effect but little transport of material, and
k417 merely lower the general level by dissolving the underlying limestone,
k418 so that the plateau surface is left with a coating of nodules and blocks
k419 of insoluble flint and chert. Flint implements might thus be expected
k420 to remain in many localities for indefinite periods, but they would
k421 certainly become more or less 'patinated,' pitted on the surface, and
k422 rounded at the angles after long exposure to heat, cold, and blown
k423 sand." This is exactly the case of the Palæolithic flint tools from the
k424 desert plateau.
k425 
k426 [Illustration: 012.jpg UPPER DESERT PLATEAU, WHERE PALEOLITHIC
k427 IMPLEMENTS ARE FOUND, Thebes: 1,400 leet above the Nile.]
k428 
k429 We do not know whether Palæolithic man in Egypt was contemporary with
k430 the cave-man of Europe. We have no means of gauging the age of the
k431 Palæolithic Egyptian weapons, as we have for the Neolithic period.
k432 The historical (dynastic) period of Egyptian annals began with the
k433 unification of the kingdom under one head somewhere about 4500 B.C. At
k434 that time copper as well as stone weapons were used, so that we may say
k435 that at the beginning of the historical age the Egyptians were living
k436 in the "Chalcolithic" period. We can trace the use of copper back for
k437 a considerable period anterior to the beginning of the Ist Dynasty,
k438 so that we shall probably not be far wrong if we do not bring down the
k439 close of the purely Neolithic Age in Egypt--the close of the Age of
k440 Stone, properly so called--later than +5000 B.C. How far back in the
k441 remote ages the transition period between the Palæolithic and Neolithic
k442 Ages should be placed, it is utterly impossible to say. The use of stone
k443 for weapons and implements continued in Egypt as late as the time of
k444 the XIIth Dynasty, about 2500-2000 B.C. But these XIIth Dynasty stone
k445 implements show by their forms how late they are in the history of the
k446 Stone Age. The axe heads, for instance, are in form imitations of
k447 the copper and bronze axe heads usual at that period; they are stone
k448 imitations of metal, instead of the originals on whose model the metal
k449 weapons were formed. The flint implements of the XIIth Dynasty were
k450 a curious survival from long past ages. After the time of the XIIth
k451 Dynasty stone was no longer used for tools or weapons, except for the
k452 sacred rite of making the first incision in the dead bodies before
k453 beginning the operations of embalming; for this purpose, as Herodotus
k454 tells us, an "Ethiopian stone" was used. This was no doubt a knife of
k455 flint or chert, like those of the Neolithic ancestors of the Egyptians,
k456 and the continued use of a stone knife for this one purpose only is a
k457 very interesting instance of a ceremonial survival. We may compare the
k458 wigs of British judges.
k459 
k460 [Illustration: 014.jpg FLINT KNIFE]
k461 
k462 We have no specimen of a flint knife which can definitely be asserted to
k463 have belonged to an embalmer, but of the archaistic flint weapons of the
k464 XIIth Dynasty we have several specimens. They were found by Prof. Petrie
k465 at the place named by him "Kahun," the site of a XIIth Dynasty town
k466 built near the pyramid of King Usertsen (or Senusret) II at Illahun,
k467 at the mouth of the canal leading from the Nile valley into the
k468 oasis-province of the Payyum. These Kahun flints, and others of probably
k469 the same period found by Mr. Seton-Karr at the very ancient flint
k470 works in the Wadi esh-Shêkh, are of very coarse and poor workmanship
k471 as compared with the stone-knapping triumphs of the late Neolithic and
k472 early Chalcolithic periods. The delicacy of the art had all been lost.
k473 But the best flint knives of the early period--dating to just a little
k474 before the time of the Ist Dynasty, when flint-working had attained its
k475 apogee, and copper had just begun to be used--are undoubtedly the most
k476 remarkable stone weapons ever made in the world. The grace and utility
k477 of the form, the delicacy of the fluted chipping on the side, and
k478 the minute care with which the tiny serrations of the cutting edge,
k479 serrations so small that often they can hardly be seen with the naked
k480 eye, are made, can certainly not be parallelled elsewhere. The art
k481 of flint-knapping reached its zenith in Ancient Egypt. The specimen
k482 illustrated has a handle covered with gold decorated with incised
k483 designs representing animals.
k484 
k485 The prehistoric Egyptians may also fairly be said to have attained
k486 greater perfection than other peoples in the Neolithic stage of culture,
k487 in other arts besides the making of stone tools and weapons. Their
k488 pottery is of remarkable perfection. Now that the sites of the Egyptian
k489 prehistoric settlements have been so thoroughly explored by competent
k490 archæologists (and, unhappily, as thoroughly pillaged by incompetent
k491 natives), this prehistoric Egyptian pottery has become extremely well
k492 known. In fact, it is so common that good specimens may be bought
k493 anywhere in Egypt for a few piastres. Most museums possess sets of this
k494 pottery, of which great quantities have been brought back from Egypt
k495 by Prof. Petrie and other explorers. It is of very great interest,
k496 artistically as well as historically. The potter's wheel was not yet
k497 invented, and all the vases, even those of the most perfect shape, were
k498 built up by hand. The perfection of form attained without the aid of the
k499 wheel is truly marvellous.
k500 
k501 The commonest type of this pottery is a red polished ware vase with
k502 black top, due to its having been baked mouth downward in a fire, the
k503 ashes of which, according to Prof. Petrie, deoxidized the hæmatite
k504 burnishing, and so turned the red colour to black. "In good examples
k505 the hæmatite has not only been reduced to black magnetic oxide, but
k506 the black has the highest polish, as seen on fine Greek vases. This is
k507 probably due to the formation of carbonyl gas in the smothered fire.
k508 This gas acts as a solvent of magnetic oxide, and hence allows it to
k509 assume a new surface, like the glassy surface of some marbles subjected
k510 to solution in water." This black and red ware appears to be the most
k511 ancient prehistoric Egyptian pottery known. Later in date are a red
k512 ware and a black ware with rude geometrical incised designs, imitating
k513 basketwork, and with the incised lines filled in with white. Later again
k514 is a buff ware, either plain or decorated with wavy lines, concentric
k515 circles, and elaborate drawings of boats sailing on the Nile, ostriches,
k516 fish, men and women, and so on.
k517 
k518 [Illustration: 017.jpg (right) BUFF WARE VASE, Predynastic period,
k519 before 4000 B.C.]
k520 
k521 These designs are in deep red. With this elaborate pottery the Neolithic
k522 ceramic art of Egypt reached its highest point; in the succeeding period
k523 (the beginning of the historic age) there was a decline in workmanship,
k524 exhibiting clumsy forms and bad colour, and it is not until the time of
k525 the IVth Dynasty that good pottery (a fine polished red) is once more
k526 found. Meanwhile the invention of glazed pottery, which was unknown to
k527 the prehistoric Egyptians, had been made (before the beginning of the
k528 Ist Dynasty). The unglazed ware of the first three dynasties was bad,
k529 but the new invention of light blue glazed faience (not porcelain
k530 properly so called) seems to have made great progress, and we possess
k531 fine specimens at the beginning of the Ist Dynasty. The prehistoric
k532 Egyptians were also proficient in other arts. They carved ivory and they
k533 worked gold, which is known to have been almost the first metal worked
k534 by man; certainly in Egypt it was utilized for ornament even before
k535 copper was used for work. We may refer to the illustration of a flint
k536 knife with gold handle, already given. [* See illustration.]
k537 
k538 The date of the actual introduction of copper for tools and weapons into
k539 Egypt is uncertain, but it seems probable that copper was occasionally
k540 used at a very early period. Copper weapons have been found in
k541 pre-dynastic graves beside the finest buff pottery with elaborate red
k542 designs, so that we may say that when the flint-working and pottery of
k543 the Neolithic Egyptians had reached its zenith, the use of copper was
k544 already known, and copper weapons were occasionally employed. We can
k545 thus speak of the "Chalcolithic" period in Egypt as having already begun
k546 at that time, no doubt several centuries before the beginning of the
k547 historical or dynastic age. Strictly speaking, the Egyptians remained
k548 in the "Chalcolithic" period till the end of the XIIth Dynasty, but in
k549 practice it is best to speak of this period, when the word is used, as
k550 extending from the time of the finest flint weapons and pottery of the
k551 prehistoric age (when the "Neolithic" period may be said to close) till
k552 about the IId or IIId Dynasty. By that time the "Bronze," or, rather,
k553 "Copper," Age of Egypt had well begun, and already stone was not in
k554 common use.
k555 
k556 The prehistoric pottery is of the greatest value to the archæologist,
k557 for with its help some idea may be obtained of the succession of periods
k558 within the late Neolithic-Chalcolithic Age. The enormous number of
k559 prehistoric graves which have been examined enables us to make an
k560 exhaustive comparison of the different kinds of pottery found in
k561 them, so that we can arrange them in order according to pottery they
k562 contained. By this means we obtain an idea of the development of
k563 different types of pottery, and the sequence of the types. Thus it is
k564 that we can say with some degree of confidence that the black and red
k565 ware is the most ancient form, and that the buff with red designs is one
k566 of the latest forms of prehistoric pottery. Other objects found in the
k567 graves can be classified as they occur with different pottery types.
k568 
k569 With the help of the pottery we can thus gain a more or less reliable
k570 conspectus of the development of the late "Neolithic" culture of Egypt.
k571 This system of "sequence-dating" was introduced by Prof. Petrie, and is
k572 certainly very useful. It must not, however, be pressed too far or be
k573 regarded as an iron-bound system, with which all subsequent discoveries
k574 must be made to fit in by force. It is not to be supposed that all
k575 prehistoric pottery developed its series of types in an absolutely
k576 orderly manner without deviations or throws-back. The work of man's
k577 hands is variable and eccentric, and does not develop or evolve in an
k578 undeviating course as the work of nature does. It is a mistake, very
k579 often made by anthropologists and archæologists, who forget this
k580 elementary fact, to assume "curves of development," and so forth, or
k581 semi-savage culture, on absolutely even and regular lines. Human culture
k582 has not developed either evenly or regularly, as a matter of fact.
k583 Therefore we cannot always be sure that, because the Egyptian black and
k584 red pottery does not occur in graves with buff and red, it is for
k585 this reason absolutely earlier in date than the latter. Some of the
k586 development-sequences may in reality be contemporary with others instead
k587 of earlier, and allowance must always be made for aberrations and
k588 reversions to earlier types.
k589 
k590 This caveat having been entered, however, we may provisionally
k591 accept Prof. Petrie's system of sequence-dating as giving the best
k592 classification of the prehistoric antiquities according to development.
k593 So it may fairly be said that, as far as we know, the black and red
k594 pottery ("sequence-date 30--") is the most ancient Neolithic Egyptian
k595 ware known; that the buff and red did not begin to be used till about
k596 "sequence-date 45;" that bone and ivory carvings were commonest in the
k597 earlier period ("sequence-dates 30-50"); that copper was almost unknown
k598 till "sequence-date 50," and so on. The arbitrary numbers used range
k599 from 30 to 80, in order to allow for possible earlier and later
k600 additions, which may be rendered necessary by the progress of discovery.
k601 The numbers are of course as purely arbitrary and relative as those
k602 of the different thermometrical systems, but they afford a convenient
k603 system of arrangement. The products of the prehistoric Egyptians are, so
k604 to speak, distributed on a conventional plan over a scale numbered from
k605 30 to 80, 30 representing the beginning and 80 the close of the term,
k606 so far as its close has as yet been ascertained. It is probable that
k607 "sequence-date 80" more or less accurately marks the beginning of the
k608 dynastic or historical period.
k609 
k610 This hypothetically chronological classification is, as has been said,
k611 due to Prof. Petrie, and has been adopted by Mr. Randall-Maclver and
k612 other students of prehistoric Egypt in their work. [*_El Amra and
k613 Abydos_, Egypt Exploration Fund, 1902.] To Prof. Petrie then is due the
k614 credit of systematizing the study of Egyptian prehistoric antiquities;
k615 but the further credit of having _discovered_ these antiquities
k616 themselves and settled their date belongs not to him but to the
k617 distinguished French archæologist, M. J. de Morgan, who was for several
k618 years director of the museum at Giza, and is now chief of the French
k619 archæological delegation in Persia, which has made of late years so many
k620 important discoveries. The proof of the prehistoric date of this class
k621 of antiquities was given, not by Prof. Petrie after his excavations at
k622 Dendera in 1897-8, but by M. de Morgan in his volume, _Recherches sur
k623 les Origines de l'Égypte: l'Âge de la Pierre et les Métaux_, published
k624 in 1895-6. In this book the true chronological position of the
k625 prehistoric antiquities was pointed out, and the existence of an
k626 Egyptian Stone Age finally decided. M. de Morgan's work was based on
k627 careful study of the results of excavations carried on for several years
k628 by the Egyptian government in various parts of Egypt, in the course
k629 of which a large number of cemeteries of the primitive type had been
k630 discovered. It was soon evident to M. de Morgan that these primitive
k631 graves, with their unusual pottery and flint implements, could be
k632 nothing less than the tombs of the prehistoric Egyptians, the Egyptians
k633 of the Stone Age.
k634 
k635 Objects of the prehistoric period had been known to the museums for many
k636 years previously, but owing to the uncertainty of their provenance and
k637 the absence of knowledge of the existence of the primitive cemeteries,
k638 no scientific conclusions had been arrived at with regard to them; and
k639 it was not till the publication of M. de Morgan's book that they were
k640 recognized and classified as prehistoric. The necropoles investigated
k641 by M. de Morgan and his assistants extended from Kawâmil in the north,
k642 about twenty miles north of Abydos, to Edfu in the south. The chief
k643 cemeteries between these two points were those of Bât Allam, Saghel
k644 el-Baglieh, el-'Amra, Nakâda, Tûkh, and Gebelên. All the burials were
k645 of simple type, analogous to those of the Neolithic races in the rest
k646 of the world. In a shallow, oval grave, excavated often but a few inches
k647 below the surface of the soil, lay the body, cramped up with the knees
k648 to the chin, sometimes in a rough box of pottery, more often with only
k649 a mat to cover it. Ready to the hand of the dead man were his flint
k650 weapons and tools, and the usual red and black, or buff and red, pots
k651 lay beside him; originally, no doubt, they had been filled with the
k652 funeral meats, to sustain the ghost in the next world. Occasionally a
k653 simple copper weapon was found. With the body were also buried slate
k654 palettes for grinding the green eye-paint which the Egyptians loved even
k655 at this early period. These are often carved to suggest the forms of
k656 animals, such as birds, bats, tortoises, goats, etc.; on others are
k657 fantastic creatures with two heads. Combs of bone, too, are found,
k658 ornamented in a similar way with birds' or goats' heads, often double.
k659 And most interesting of all are the small bone and ivory figures of men
k660 and women which are also found. These usually have little blue beads for
k661 eyes, and are of the quaintest and naivest appearance conceivable. Here
k662 we have an elderly man with a long pointed beard, there two women with
k663 inane smiles upon their countenances, here another woman, of better work
k664 this time, with a child slung across her shoulder. This figure, which
k665 is in the British Museum, must be very late, as prehistoric Egyptian
k666 antiquities go. It is almost as good in style as the early Ist Dynasty
k667 objects. Such were the objects which the simple piety of the early
k668 Egyptian prompted him to bury with the bodies of his dead, in order that
k669 they might find solace and contentment in the other world.
k670 
k671 All the prehistoric cemeteries are of this type, with the graves pressed
k672 closely together, so that they often impinge upon one another. The
k673 nearness of the graves to the surface is due to the exposed positions,
k674 at the entrances to _wadis_, in which the primitive cemeteries are
k675 usually found. The result is that they are always swept by the winds,
k676 which prevent the desert sand from accumulating over them, and so have
k677 preserved the original level of the ground. From their proximity to
k678 the surface they are often found disturbed, more often by the agency of
k679 jackals than that of man.
k680 
k681 Contemporaneously with M. de Morgan's explorations, Prof. Flinders
k682 Petrie and Mr. J. Quibell had, in the winter of 1894-5, excavated in
k683 the districts of Tukh and Nakada, on the west bank of the Nile opposite
k684 Koptos, a series of extensive cemeteries of the primitive type, from
k685 which they obtained a large number of antiquities, published in their
k686 volume Nagada and Dallas. The plates giving representations of the
k687 antiquities found were of the highest interest, but the scientific value
k688 of the letter-press is vitiated by the fact that the true historical
k689 position of the antiquities was not perceived by their discoverers, who
k690 came to the conclusion that these remains were those of a "New Pace" of
k691 Libyan invaders. This race, they supposed, had entered Egypt after the
k692 close of the flourishing period of the "Old Kingdom" at the end of the
k693 VIth Dynasty, and had occupied part of the Nile valley from that time
k694 till the period of the Xth Dynasty.
k695 
k696 This conclusion was proved erroneous by M. de Morgan almost as soon
k697 as made, and the French archæologist's identification of the primitive
k698 remains as pre-dynastic was at once generally accepted. It was obvious
k699 that a hypothesis of the settlement of a stone-using barbaric race in
k700 the midst of Egypt at so late a date as the period immediately preceding
k701 the XIIth Dynasty, a race which mixed in no way with the native
k702 Egyptians themselves, and left no trace of their influence upon the
k703 later Egyptians, was one which demanded greater faith than the simple
k704 explanation of M. de Morgan.
k705 
k706 The error of the British explorers was at once admitted by Mr. Quibell,
k707 in his volume on the excavations of 1897 at el-Kab, published in 1898.*
k708 Mr. Quibell at once found full and adequate confirmation of M. de
k709 Morgan's discovery in his diggings at el-Kab. Prof. Petrie admitted
k710 the correctness of M. de Morgan's views in the preface to his volume
k711 Diospolis Parva, published three years later in 1901.** The preface to
k712 the first volume of M. de Morgan's book contained a generous recognition
k713 of the method and general accuracy of Prof. Petrie's excavations, which
k714 contrasted favourably, according to M. de Morgan, with the excavations
k715 of others, generally carried on without scientific control, and with
k716 the sole aim of obtaining antiquities or literary texts.*** That M. de
k717 Morgan's own work was carried out as scientifically and as carefully
k718 is evident from the fact that his conclusions as to the chronological
k719 position of the prehistoric antiquities have been shown to be correct.
k720 To describe M. de Morgan's discovery as a "happy guess," as has been
k721 done, is therefore beside the mark.

k728 
k729 Another most important British excavation was that carried on by
k730 Messrs. Randall-Maclver and Wilkin at el-'Amra. The imposing lion-headed
k731 promontory of el-'Amra stands out into the plain on the west bank of the
k732 Nile about five miles south of Abydos. At the foot of this hill M. de
k733 Morgan found a very extensive prehistoric necropolis, which he examined,
k734 but did not excavate to any great extent, and the work of thoroughly
k735 excavating it was performed by Messrs. Randall-MacIver and Wilkin for
k736 the Egypt Exploration Fund. The results have thrown very great light
k737 upon the prehistoric culture of Egypt, and burials of all prehistoric
k738 types, some of them previously unobserved, were found. Among the most
k739 interesting are burials in pots, which have also been found by Mr.
k740 Garstang in a predynastic necropolis at Ragagna, north of Abydos. One
k741 of the more remarkable observations made at el-'Amra was the progressive
k742 development of the tombs from the simplest pot-burial to a small brick
k743 chamber, the embryo of the brick tombs of the Ist Dynasty. Among the
k744 objects recovered from this site may be mentioned a pottery model of
k745 oxen, a box in the shape of a model hut, and a slate "palette" with what
k746 is perhaps the oldest Egyptian hieroglyph known, a representation of the
k747 fetish-sign of the god Min, in relief. All these are preserved in the
k748 British Museum. The skulls of the bodies found were carefully preserved
k749 for craniometric examination.
k750 
k751 In 1901 an extensive prehistoric cemetery was being excavated by Messrs.
k752 Reisner and Lythgoe at Nag'ed-Dêr, opposite Girga, and at el-Ahaiwa,
k753 further north, another prehistoric necropolis has been excavated by
k754 these gentlemen, working for the University of California.
k755 
k756 [Illustration: 027.jpg CAMP OF THE EXPEDITION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
k757 CALIFORNIA AT NAG' ED-DÊR, 1901.]
k758 
k759 The cemetery of Nag'ed-Dêr is of the usual prehistoric type, with its
k760 multitudes of small oval graves, excavated just a little way below the
k761 surface. Graves of this kind are the most primitive of all. Those at
k762 el-'Amra are usually more developed, often, as has been noted, rising to
k763 the height of regular brick tombs. They are evidently later, nearer to
k764 the time of the Ist Dynasty. The position of the Nag'ed-Dêr cemetery is
k765 also characteristic. It lies on the usual low ridge at the entrance to a
k766 desert _wadi_, which is itself one of the most picturesque in this
k767 part of Egypt, with its chaos of great boulders and fallen rocks. An
k768 illustration of the camp of Mr. Reisner's expedition at Nag'ed-Dêr is
k769 given above. The excavations of the University of California are carried
k770 out with the greatest possible care and are financed with the greatest
k771 possible liberality. Mr. Reisner has therefore been able to keep an
k772 absolutely complete photographic record of everything, even down to
k773 the successive stages in the opening of a tomb, which will be of the
k774 greatest use to science when published.
k775 
k776 For a detailed study of the antiquities of the prehistoric period the
k777 publications of Prof. Petrie, Mr. Quibell, and Mr. Randall-Maclver are
k778 more useful than that of M. de Morgan, who does not give enough details.
k779 Every atom of evidence is given in the publications of the British
k780 explorers, whereas it is a characteristic of French work to give
k781 brilliant conclusions, beautifully illustrated, without much of the
k782 evidence on which the conclusions are based. This kind of work does not
k783 appeal to the Anglo-Saxon mind, which takes nothing on trust, even
k784 from the most renowned experts, and always wants to know the why and
k785 wherefore. The complete publication of evidence which marks the British
k786 work will no doubt be met with, if possible in even more complete
k787 detail, in the American work of Messrs. Reisner, Lythgoe, and Mace (the
k788 last-named is an Englishman) for the University of California, when
k789 published. The question of speedy versus delayed publication is a very
k790 vexing one. Prof. Petrie prefers to publish as speedily as possible; six
k791 months after the season's work in Egypt is done, the full publication
k792 with photographs of everything appears. Mr. Reisner and the French
k793 explorers prefer to publish nothing until they have exhaustively studied
k794 the whole of the evidence, and can extract nothing more from it. This
k795 would be admirable if the French published their discoveries fully, but
k796 they do not. Even M. de Morgan has not approached the fulness of
k797 detail which characterizes British work and which will characterize Mr.
k798 Reisner's publication when it appears. The only drawback to this method
k799 is that general interest in the particular excavations described tends
k800 to pass away before the full description appears.
k801 
k802 Prof. Petrie has explored other prehistoric sites at Abadiya, and Mr.
k803 Quibell at el-Kab. M. de Morgan and his assistants have examined a large
k804 number of sites, ranging from the Delta to el-Kab. Further research has
k805 shown that some of the sites identified by M. de Morgan as prehistoric
k806 are in reality of much later date, for example, Kahun, where the late
k807 flints of XIIth Dynasty date were found. He notes that "large numbers
k808 of Neolithic flint weapons are found in the desert on the borders of
k809 the Fayyum, and at Helwan, south of Cairo," and that all the important
k810 necropoles and kitchen-middens of the predynastic people are to be found
k811 in the districts of Abydos and Thebes, from el-Kawamil in the North to
k812 el-Kab in the South. It is of course too soon to assert with confidence
k813 that there are no prehistoric remains in any other part of Egypt,
k814 especially in the long tract between the Fayyûm and the district of
k815 Abydos, but up to the present time none have been found in this region.
k816 
k817 This geographical distribution of the prehistoric remains fits in
k818 curiously with the ancient legend concerning the origin of the ancestors
k819 of the Egyptians in Upper Egypt, and supports the much discussed theory
k820 that they came originally to the Nile valley from the shores of the Red
k821 Sea by way of the Wadi Hammamat, which debouches on to the Nile in the
k822 vicinity of Koptos and Kus, opposite Ballas and Tûkh. The supposition
k823 seems a very probable one, and it may well be that the earliest
k824 Egyptians entered the valley of the Nile by the route suggested and
k825 then spread northwards and southwards in the valley. The fact that their
k826 remains are not found north of el-Kawâmil nor south of el-Kab might
k827 perhaps be explained by the supposition that, when they had extended
k828 thus far north and south from their original place of arrival, they
k829 passed from the primitive Neolithic condition to the more highly
k830 developed copper-using culture of the period which immediately preceded
k831 the establishment of the monarchy. The Neolithic weapons of the Fayyûm
k832 and Hel-wân would then be the remains of a different people, which
k833 inhabited the Delta and Middle Egypt in very early times. This people
k834 may have been of Mediterranean stock, akin to the primitive inhabitants
k835 of Palestine, Greece, Italy, and Spain; and they no doubt were identical
k836 with the inhabitants of Lower Egypt who were overthrown and conquered by
k837 Kha-sekhem and the other Southern founders of the monarchy (who belonged
k838 to the race which had come from the Red Sea by the Wadi Hammamat), and
k839 so were the ancestors of the later natives of Lower Egypt. Whether the
k840 Southerners, whose primitive remains we find from el-Kawâmil to el-Kab,
k841 were of the same race as the Northerners whom they conquered, cannot
k842 be decided. The skull-form of the Southerners agrees with that of the
k843 Mediterranean races. But we have no nécropoles of the Northerners to
k844 tell us much of their peculiarities. We have nothing but their flint
k845 arrowheads.
k846 
k847 But it should be observed that, in spite of the present absence of all
k848 primitive remains (whether mere flints, or actual graves with bodies and
k849 relics) of the primeval population between the Fayyûm and el-Kawâmil,
k850 there is no proof that the primitive race of Upper Egypt was not
k851 coterminous and identical with that of the lower country. It
k852 might therefore be urged that the whole Neolithic population was
k853 "Mediterranean" by its skull-form and body-structure, and specifically
k854 "Nilotic" (indigenous Egyptian) in its culture-type. This is quite
k855 possible, but we have again to account for the legends of distant origin
k856 on the Red Sea coast, the probability that one element of the Egyptian
k857 population was of extraneous origin and came from the east into the Nile
k858 valley near Koptos, and finally the historical fact of an advance of the
k859 early dynastic Egyptians from the South to the conquest of the North.
k860 The latter fact might of course be explained as a civil war analogous
k861 to that between Thebes and Asyût in the time of the IXth Dynasty, but
k862 against this explanation is to be set the fact that the contemporary
k863 monuments of the Southerners exhibit the men of the North as of foreign
k864 and non-Egyptian ethnic type, resembling Libyans. It is possible that
k865 they were akin to the Libyans; and this would square very well with the
k866 first theory, but it may also be made to fit in with a development of
k867 the second, which has been generally accepted.
k868 
k869 According to this view, the whole primitive Neolithic population of
k870 North and South was Miotic, indigenous in origin, and akin to the
k871 "Mediterraneans "of Prof. Sergi and the other ethnologists. It was not
k872 this population, the stone-users whose nécropoles have been found by
k873 Messrs. de Morgan, Pétrie, and Maclver, that entered the Nile valley by
k874 the Wadi Hammamat. This was another race of different ethnic origin,
k875 which came from the Red Sea toward the end of the Neolithic period,
k876 and, being of higher civilization than the native Nilotes, assumed the
k877 lordship over them, gave a great impetus to the development of their
k878 culture, and started at once the institution of monarchy, the knowledge
k879 of letters, and the use of metals. The chiefs of this superior tribe
k880 founded the monarchy, conquered the North, unified the kingdom, and
k881 began Egyptian history. From many indications it would seem probable
k882 that these conquerors were of Babylonian origin, or that the culture
k883 they brought with them (possibly from Arabia) was ultimately of
k884 Babylonian origin. They themselves would seem to have been Semites,
k885 or rather proto-Semites, who came from Arabia to Africa by way of
k886 the straits of Bab el-Mandeb, and proceeded up the coast to about the
k887 neighbourhood of Kusêr, whence the Wadi Hammamat offered them an open
k888 road to the valley of the Nile. By this route they may have entered
k889 Egypt, bringing with them a civilization, which, like that of the other
k890 Semites, had been profoundly influenced and modified by that of the
k891 Sumerian inhabitants of Babylonia. This Semitic-Sumerian culture,
k892 mingling with that of the Nilotes themselves, produced the civilization
k893 of Ancient Egypt as we know it.
k894 
k895 This is a very plausible hypothesis, and has a great deal of evidence in
k896 its favour. It seems certain that in the early dynastic period two
k897 races lived in Egypt, which differed considerably in type, and also,
k898 apparently, in burial customs. The later Egyptians always buried the
k899 dead lying on their backs, extended at full length. During the period of
k900 the Middle Kingdom (XIth-XIIIth Dynasties) the head was usually turned
k901 over on to the left side, in order that the dead man might look through
k902 the two great eyes painted on that side of the coffin. Afterward the
k903 rigidly extended position was always adopted. The Neolithic Egyptians,
k904 however, buried the dead lying wholly on the left side and in a
k905 contracted position, with the knees drawn up to the chin. The bodies
k906 were not embalmed, and the extended position and mummification were
k907 never used. Under the IVth Dynasty we find in the necropolis of Mêdûm
k908 (north of the Payyûm) the two positions used simultaneously, and the
k909 extended bodies are mummified. The contracted bodies are skeletons, as
k910 in the case of most of the predynastic bodies. When these are found with
k911 flesh, skin, and hair intact, their preservation is due to the dryness
k912 of the soil and the preservative salts it contains, not to intentional
k913 embalming, which was evidently introduced by those who employed the
k914 extended position in burial. The contracted position is found as late as
k915 the Vth Dynasty at Dashasha, south of the Eayyûm, but after that date it
k916 is no longer found.
k917 
k918 The conclusion is obvious that the contracted position without
k919 mummification, which the Neolithic people used, was supplanted in the
k920 early dynastic period by the extended position with mummification, and
k921 by the time of the VIth Dynasty it was entirely superseded. This points
k922 to the supersession of the burial customs of the indigenous Neolithic
k923 race by those of another race which conquered and dominated the
k924 indigenes. And, since the extended burials of the IVth Dynasty are
k925 evidently those of the higher nobles, while the contracted ones are
k926 those of inferior people, it is probable that the customs of extended
k927 burial and embalming were introduced by a foreign race which founded the
k928 Egyptian monarchical state, with its hierarchy of nobles and officials,
k929 and in fact started Egyptian civilization on its way. The conquerors of
k930 the North were thus not the descendants of the Neolithic people of the
k931 South, but their conquerors; in fact, they dominated the indigenes both
k932 of North and South, who will then appear (since we find the custom of
k933 contracted burial in the North at Dashasha and Mêdûm) to have originally
k934 belonged to the same race.
k935 
k936 The conquering race is that which is supposed to have been of Semitic or
k937 proto-Semitic origin, and to have brought elements of Sumerian culture
k938 to savage Egypt. The reasons advanced for this supposition are the
k939 following:--
k940 
k941 (1) Just as the Egyptian race was evidently compounded of two elements,
k942 of conquered "Mediterraneans" and conquering x, so the Egyptian language
k943 is evidently compounded of two elements, the one Nilotic, perhaps
k944 related in some degree to the Berber dialects of North Africa, the other
k945 not x, but evidently Semitic.
k946 
k947 (2) Certain elements of the early dynastic civilization, which do not
k948 appear in that of the earlier pre-dynastic period, resemble well-known
k949 elements of the civilization of Babylonia. We may instance the use of
k950 the cylinder-seal, which died out in Egypt in the time of the XVIIIth
k951 Dynasty, but was always used in Babylonia from the earliest to the
k952 latest times. The early Egyptian mace-head is of exactly the same
k953 type as the early Babylonian one. In the British Museum is an Egyptian
k954 mace-head of red breccia, which is identical in shape and size with
k955 one from Babylonia (also in the museum) bearing the name of
k956 Shargani-shar-ali (i.e. Sargon, King of Agade), one of the earliest
k957 Chaldæan monarchs, who must have lived about the same time as the
k958 Egyptian kings of the IId-IIId Dynasties, to which period the Egyptian
k959 mace-head may also be approximately assigned. The Egyptian art of the
k960 earliest dynasties bears again a remarkable resemblance to that of early
k961 Babylonia. It is not till the time of the IId Dynasty that Egyptian art
k962 begins to take upon itself the regular form which we know so well, and
k963 not till that of the IVth that this form was finally crystallized. Under
k964 the 1st Dynasty we find the figure of man or, to take other instances,
k965 that of a lion, or a hawk, or a snake, often treated in a style very
k966 different from that in which we are accustomed to see a man, a lion, a
k967 hawk, or a snake depicted in works of the later period. And the striking
k968 thing is that these early representations, which differ so much from
k969 what we find in later Egyptian art, curiously resemble the works of
k970 early Babylonian art, of the time of the patesis of Shirpurla or the
k971 Kings Shargani-shar-ali and Narâm-Sin. One of the best known relics
k972 of the early art of Babylonia is the famous "Stele of Vultures" now in
k973 Paris. On this we see the enemies of Eannadu, one of the early rulers
k974 of Shirpurla, cast out to be devoured by the vultures. On an Egyptian
k975 relief of slate, evidently originally dedicated in a temple record of
k976 some historical event, and dating from the beginning of the Ist Dynasty
k977 (practically contemporary, according to our latest knowledge, with
k978 Eannadu), we have an almost exactly similar scene of captives being cast
k979 out into the desert, and devoured by lions and vultures. The two reliefs
k980 are curiously alike in their clumsy, naïve style of art. A further
k981 point is that the official represented on the stele, who appears to be
k982 thrusting one of the bound captives out to die, wears a long fringed
k983 garment of Babylonish cut, quite different from the clothes of the later
k984 Egyptians.
k985 
k986 (3) There are evidently two distinct and different main strata in the
k987 fabric of Egyptian religion. On the one hand we find a mass of myth and
k988 religious belief of very primitive, almost savage, cast, combining
k989 a worship of the actual dead in their tombs--which were supposed
k990 to communicate and thus form a veritable "underworld," or, rather,
k991 "under-Egypt"--with veneration of magic animals, such as jackals, cats,
k992 hawks, and crocodiles. On the other hand, we have a sun and sky worship
k993 of a more elevated nature, which does not seem to have amalgamated with
k994 the earlier fetishism and corpse-worship until a comparatively late
k995 period. The main seats of the sun-worship were at Heliopolis in the
k996 Delta and at Edfu in Upper Egypt. Heliopolis seems always to have been
k997 a centre of light and leading in Egypt, and it is, as is well known,
k998 the On of the Bible, at whose university the Jewish lawgiver Moses is
k999 related to have been educated "in all the wisdom of the Egyptians." The
